### Pop-Up Message Boxes with PyMsgBox
While designing a full GUI for your program requires learning an entire code library such as Tkinter, wxPython, or PyQt, you can add small GUI message boxes to your program with the PyMsgBox package. This is a third party package you can install by running `pip install pymsgbox` from the terminal. PyMsgBox lets you create dialog boxes using Tkinter, which comes with Python on Windows and macOS. On Ubuntu Linux, you must first install Tkinter by running `sudo apt-get install python3-tk` in the terminal.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PyMsgBox has functions with names that mirror JavaScript’s message box functions:
- **pymsgbox.alert(text)** - Displays a text message until the user clicks OK, then returns the string 'OK'
- **pymsgbox .confirm(text)** - Displays a text message until the user clicks OK or Cancel, then returns 'OK' or 'Cancel'
- **pymsgbox.prompt(text)** - Displays a text message along with a text field, then returns the text the user entered as a string or None if they clicked Cancel
- **pymsgbox.password(text)** - Is the same as `pymsgbox.prompt()`, but the text the user enters is masked by asterisks.  

These functions won’t return until the user clicks OK, Cancel, or X (close). If your program requires only the occasional notification or user input, using PyMsgBox’s dialog boxes could be a suitable replacement for `print()` and `input()`.

### Deploying Python Programs
Once your Python program is finished, you might want to run it in as few keystrokes as possible.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure to add a *Scripts* folder to your `PATH` environment variable. Say my username is *al*, the path to this folder is *C:\Users\al\Scripts* on Windows, */Users/al/Scripts* on macOS, and */home/al/Scripts* on Linux. Also, you’ll need to set up a virtual environment for the Python scripts, as described next.
#### Windows:
On Windows, you can bring up the Run dialog box by pressing the Windows key and the R key simultaneously (or right-clicking the Start menu button and selecting Run). This opens a small window that acts like a one-use terminal: in it, you can run a single command. To run your Python scripts from here, you’ll need to do the following:
 1. Place the *yourScript.py* Python script in your *Scripts* folder.
 2. Create a *yourScript.bat* batch file in your *Scripts* folder to run the Python script.

*Batch* files contain terminal commands that can be run together by running the batch file. They have a *.bat* file extension and are similar to shell scripts on Linux or *.command* scripts on macOS. If you place a batch file named *yourScript.bat* in a `PATH` folder, you can run it from the Run dialog box by entering `yourScript`. On Windows, you don’t need to enter the file extension to run *.bat* or *.exe* files.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of a batch file is plaintext, just like a *.py* file, so you can create batch files with a text editor like Notepad. Batch files contain one command per line. To run a *yourScript.py* file located in a folder *C:\Users\al\Scripts*, create a file named *yourScript.bat* with the following contents:
```bash
@call %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\Scripts\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
@python %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\Scripts\yourScript.py %*
@pause
@deactivate
```
With the batch file set up, now you can run your Python script by pressing the Windows key + R key combination to bring up the Run dialog box and entering `yourScript` (followed by any command line arguments) to run the *yourScript.bat* script. Or, if you have a terminal window open, you can just enter `yourScript` in the terminal from any folder. This is far quicker than running it from a code editor.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you create other Python scripts, you can reuse this batch file. Just copy the file with a new name and change the *yourScript.py* filename to the new Python script’s name. Everything else can stay the same.
#### macOS:
Pressing the `command` key and the spacebar simultaneously on macOS brings up Spotlight, allowing you to enter the name of a program to run. To add your own Python scripts to Spotlight, you must do the following:
 1. Place the *yourScript.py* Python script in your *Scripts* folder.
 2. Create a text file named *yourScript.command* to run the Python script.
 3. Run `chmod u+x yourScript.command` to add execute permissions to the *yourScript.command file*.  

Once you have your *.py* Python script in your *Scripts* folder, such as */Users/al/Scripts*, create a text file named *yourScript.command* in the *Scripts* folder with the following content:
```bash
source ~/Scripts/.venv/bin/activate
python3 ~/Scripts/yourScript.py
deactivate
```
Note that if you use macOS’s TextEdit to create the *yourScript.command* file, be sure to make it a plaintext file by pressing `shift-ζ-T` (or clicking the Format and Make Plain Text menu items). TextEdit will also try to be helpful by automatically capitalizing `python3` to `Python3`, which causes an error in Spotlight.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Spotlight has no means of letting the user pass command line arguments to the Python script. Any command line arguments must be preemptively written in the  *.command* file.
#### Ubuntu Linux:
 buntu Linux Dash can be brought up by pressing the Windows key and entering the name of the program you want to run. To add your Python script to Dash, you must do the following:
 1. Place the *yourScript.py* Python script in your Scripts folder.
 2. Create a shell script named *yourScript* to activate the virtual environment and run your Python script.
 3. Run the `chmod u+x yourScript` command to add execute permissions to the shell script.
 4. Create a *yourScript.desktop* file in the *~/.local/share/applications* folder to run the shell script from Dash.  

Once you have your *.py* Python script in your *Scripts* folder, such as */home/al/Scripts*, create a text file named *yourScript* (with no file extension) in the *Scripts* folder with the following content:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
source ~/Scripts/.venv/bin/activate
python3 ~/Scripts/yourScript.py
read -p "Press any key to continue..." -n1 –s
deactivate
```
After creating this shell script, `cd` to *~/Scripts* and run the command `chmod u+x yourScript`. This adds execute permissions so that you can run it. At this point, you’ll also be able to run your Python script from the terminal by entering `yourScript`. To run your Python script from Dash, you must create a *yourScript.desktop* file.

### Compiling Python Programs with PyInstaller
Python is often called an interpreted language, though programming languages themselves are neither interpreted nor compiled. You can create an interpreter or compiler for any language. Instead, programs written in Python are mostly *run* by interpreters. But it’s also possible to create executable programs from Python code with the PyInstaller package, which generates executable programs you can run from the command line.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PyInstaller doesn’t compile Python programs into machine code per se; rather, it creates an executable program that contains a copy of the Python interpreter and your script. As such, these programs tend to be fairly large. Even a simple “Hello, world” program compiled with PyInstaller can be close to 8MB in size, literally a thousand times larger than a version written in assembly language. However, the benefit of compiling your Python program is that you can share your program with others who don’t have Python installed. You’d be able to send them one executable file.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can install PyInstaller by running `pip install pyinstaller`. You must run PyInstaller on the operating system that you want the executable to run on. That is, if you’re on Windows, PyInstaller can create a Windows executable program but not a macOS or Linux program, and vice versa.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the terminal, run the following command (using `python3` instead of python on macOS and Linux) to compile a Python script named *yourScript.py*:
```bash
C:\Users\al>python -m PyInstaller --onefile yourScript.py
378 INFO: PyInstaller: X.X.X
378 INFO: Python: 3.XX.XX
392 INFO: Platform: Windows-XX-XX.X.XXXX
393 INFO: wrote C:\Users\al\Desktop\hello-test\hello.spec
399 INFO: UPX is not available.
--snip-
11940 INFO: Appending PKG archive to EXE
11950 INFO: Fixing EXE headers
13622 INFO: Building EXE from EXE-00.toc completed successfully.
```
Notice that you must enter *PyInstaller* with a capital *P* and capital *I* or else you’ll get a “No module named pyinstaller” error message. Also, note that the `--onefile` argument has two dashes.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After running PyInstaller, there will be a *build* folder (which you can delete) and a dist folder. The *dist* folder contains the executable program. You don’t need to create a virtual environment for it. You can then copy this program to other computers or send it as an email attachment. Keep in mind that, as a security precaution, many email providers may block emails that contain an executable program.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The instructions here work for basic Python programs. The online documentation at *https://pyinstaller.org/* contains further details.
