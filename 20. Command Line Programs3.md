### Pop-Up Message Boxes with PyMsgBox
While designing a full GUI for your program requires learning an entire code library such as Tkinter, wxPython, or PyQt, you can add small GUI message boxes to your program with the PyMsgBox package. This is a third party package you can install by running `pip install pymsgbox` from the terminal. PyMsgBox lets you create dialog boxes using Tkinter, which comes with Python on Windows and macOS. On Ubuntu Linux, you must first install Tkinter by running `sudo apt-get install python3-tk` in the terminal.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PyMsgBox has functions with names that mirror JavaScript’s message box functions:
- **pymsgbox.alert(text)** - Displays a text message until the user clicks OK, then returns the string 'OK'
- **pymsgbox .confirm(text)** - Displays a text message until the user clicks OK or Cancel, then returns 'OK' or 'Cancel'
- **pymsgbox.prompt(text)** - Displays a text message along with a text field, then returns the text the user entered as a string or None if they clicked Cancel
- **pymsgbox.password(text)** - Is the same as `pymsgbox.prompt()`, but the text the user enters is masked by asterisks.  

These functions won’t return until the user clicks OK, Cancel, or X (close). If your program requires only the occasional notification or user input, using PyMsgBox’s dialog boxes could be a suitable replacement for `print()` and `input()`.

### Deploying Python Programs
Once your Python program is finished, you might want to run it in as few keystrokes as possible.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be sure to add a *Scripts* folder to your `PATH` environment variable. Say my username is *al*, the path to this folder is *C:\Users\al\Scripts* on Windows, */Users/al/Scripts* on macOS, and */home/al/Scripts* on Linux. Also, you’ll need to set up a virtual environment for the Python scripts, as described next.
#### Windows:
On Windows, you can bring up the Run dialog box by pressing the Windows key and the R key simultaneously (or right-clicking the Start menu button and selecting Run). This opens a small window that acts like a one-use terminal: in it, you can run a single command. To run your Python scripts from here, you’ll need to do the following:
 1. Place the *yourScript.py* Python script in your *Scripts* folder.
 2. Create a *yourScript.bat* batch file in your *Scripts* folder to run the Python script.

*Batch* files contain terminal commands that can be run together by running the batch file. They have a *.bat* file extension and are similar to shell scripts on Linux or *.command* scripts on macOS. If you place a batch file named *yourScript.bat* in a `PATH` folder, you can run it from the Run dialog box by entering `yourScript`. On Windows, you don’t need to enter the file extension to run *.bat* or *.exe* files.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The content of a batch file is plaintext, just like a *.py* file, so you can create batch files with a text editor like Notepad. Batch files contain one command per line. To run a *yourScript.py* file located in a folder *C:\Users\al\Scripts*, create a file named *yourScript.bat* with the following contents:
```bash
@call %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\Scripts\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat
@python %HOMEDRIVE%%HOMEPATH%\Scripts\yourScript.py %*
@pause
@deactivate
```
With the batch file set up, now you can run your Python script by pressing the Windows key + R key combination to bring up the Run dialog box and entering `yourScript` (followed by any command line arguments) to run the *yourScript.bat* script. Or, if you have a terminal window open, you can just enter `yourScript` in the terminal from any folder. This is far quicker than running it from a code editor.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you create other Python scripts, you can reuse this batch file. Just copy the file with a new name and change the *yourScript.py* filename to the new Python script’s name. Everything else can stay the same.
#### macOS:
Pressing the `command` key and the spacebar simultaneously on macOS brings up Spotlight, allowing you to enter the name of a program to run. To add your own Python scripts to Spotlight, you must do the following:
 1. Place the *yourScript.py* Python script in your *Scripts* folder.
 2. Create a text file named *yourScript.command* to run the Python script.
 3. Run `chmod u+x yourScript.command` to add execute permissions to the *yourScript.command file*.  

Once you have your *.py* Python script in your *Scripts* folder, such as */Users/al/Scripts*, create a text file named *yourScript.command* in the *Scripts* folder with the following content:
```bash
source ~/Scripts/.venv/bin/activate
python3 ~/Scripts/yourScript.py
deactivate
```
Note that if you use macOS’s TextEdit to create the *yourScript.command* file, be sure to make it a plaintext file by pressing `shift-ζ-T` (or clicking the Format and Make Plain Text menu items). TextEdit will also try to be helpful by automatically capitalizing `python3` to `Python3`, which causes an error in Spotlight.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unfortunately, Spotlight has no means of letting the user pass command line arguments to the Python script. Any command line arguments must be preemptively written in the  *.command* file.
#### Ubuntu Linux:
 buntu Linux Dash can be brought up by pressing the Windows key and entering the name of the program you want to run. To add your Python script to Dash, you must do the following:
 1. Place the *yourScript.py* Python script in your Scripts folder.
 2. Create a shell script named *yourScript* to activate the virtual environment and run your Python script.
 3. Run the `chmod u+x yourScript` command to add execute permissions to the shell script.
 4. Create a *yourScript.desktop* file in the *~/.local/share/applications* folder to run the shell script from Dash.  

Once you have your *.py* Python script in your *Scripts* folder, such as */home/al/Scripts*, create a text file named *yourScript* (with no file extension) in the *Scripts* folder with the following content:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
source ~/Scripts/.venv/bin/activate
python3 ~/Scripts/yourScript.py
read -p "Press any key to continue..." -n1 –s
deactivate
```
After creating this shell script, `cd` to *~/Scripts* and run the command `chmod u+x yourScript`. This adds execute permissions so that you can run it. At this point, you’ll also be able to run your Python script from the terminal by entering `yourScript`. To run your Python script from Dash, you must create a *yourScript.desktop* file.
