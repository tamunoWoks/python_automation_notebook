### Pop-Up Message Boxes with PyMsgBox
While designing a full GUI for your program requires learning an entire code library such as Tkinter, wxPython, or PyQt, you can add small GUI message boxes to your program with the PyMsgBox package. This is a third party package you can install by running `pip install pymsgbox` from the terminal. PyMsgBox lets you create dialog boxes using Tkinter, which comes with Python on Windows and macOS. On Ubuntu Linux, you must first install Tkinter by running `sudo apt-get install python3-tk` in the terminal.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PyMsgBox has functions with names that mirror JavaScript’s message box functions:
- **pymsgbox.alert(text)** - Displays a text message until the user clicks OK, then returns the string 'OK'
- **pymsgbox .confirm(text)** - Displays a text message until the user clicks OK or Cancel, then returns 'OK' or 'Cancel'
- **pymsgbox.prompt(text)** - Displays a text message along with a text field, then returns the text the user entered as a string or None if they clicked Cancel
- **pymsgbox.password(text)** - Is the same as `pymsgbox.prompt()`, but the text the user enters is masked by asterisks.  

These functions won’t return until the user clicks OK, Cancel, or X (close). If your program requires only the occasional notification or user input, using PyMsgBox’s dialog boxes could be a suitable replacement for `print()` and `input()`.
