# Humre: A Module for Human-Readable Regexes
Code is read far more often than it’s written, so it’s important for your code to be readable. But the punctuation-dense syntax of regular expressions can be hard for even experienced programmers to read. To solve this, the third party `Humre` Python module takes the good ideas of verbose mode even further by using human-readable, plain-English names to create readable regex 
code.  

Let’s go back to the `r'\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}'` previous phone number example. The functions and constants in Humre can produce the same regex string with plain English:
```python
from humre import *

phone_regex = exactly(3, DIGIT) + '-' + exactly(3, DIGIT) + '-' + exactly(4, DIGIT)
phone_regex # '\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}'
```
