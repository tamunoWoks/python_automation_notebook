# Humre: A Module for Human-Readable Regexes
Code is read far more often than it’s written, so it’s important for your code to be readable. But the punctuation-dense syntax of regular expressions can be hard for even experienced programmers to read. To solve this, the third party `Humre` Python module takes the good ideas of verbose mode even further by using human-readable, plain-English names to create readable regex 
code.  

Let’s go back to the `r'\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}'` previous phone number example. The functions and constants in Humre can produce the same regex string with plain English:
```python
from humre import *

phone_regex = exactly(3, DIGIT) + '-' + exactly(3, DIGIT) + '-' + exactly(4, DIGIT)
phone_regex # '\\d{3}-\\d{3}-\\d{4}'
```
Humre’s constants (like `DIGIT`) contain strings, and Humre’s functions (like `exactly()`) return strings. Humre doesn’t replace the `re` module. Rather, it produces regex strings that can be passed to `re.compile()`:
```python
import re

pattern = re .compile(phone _regex)
pattern.search('My number is 415-555-4242')
<re.Match object; span=(13, 25), match='415-555-4242'>
```
Humre has constants and functions for each feature of regular expression syntax. You can then concatenate the constants and returned strings like any other string. For example, here are Humre’s constants for the shorthand character classes:
- `DIGIT` and `NONDIGIT` represent `r'\d'` and `r'\D'`, respectively.
- `WORD` and `NONWORD` represent `r'\w'` and `r'\W'`, respectively.
- `WHITESPACE` and `NONWHITESPACE` represent `r'\s'` and `r'\S'`, respectively.

A common source of regex bugs is forgetting which characters need to be escaped. You can use Humre’s constants instead of typing the escaped character yourself. For example, say you want to match a single-digit floating-point number with one digit after the decimal point, like '0.9' or '4.5'. However, if you use the regex string `r'\d.\d'`, you might not realize that the dot matches a period (as in '4.5') but also matches any other character (as in '4A5').
