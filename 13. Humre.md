# Humre: A Module for Human-Readable Regexes
Code is read far more often than it’s written, so it’s important for your code to be readable. But the punctuation-dense syntax of regular expressions can be hard for even experienced programmers to read. To solve this, the third party `Humre` Python module takes the good ideas of verbose mode even further by using human-readable, plain-English names to create readable regex 
code.
