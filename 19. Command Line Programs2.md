### Virtual Environments
 Say you have two Python programs, one that uses version 1.0 of a package and another that uses version 2.0 of that same package. Python can’t have two versions of the same package installed at the same time. If version 2.0 is not backward compatible with version 1.0, you’d be uninstalling one version and reinstalling the other each time you wanted to switch programs to run.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python’s solution to this problem is **virtual environments**; separate installations of Python that have their own set of installed third-party packages. In general, each Python application you create needs its own virtual environment. But you can use one virtual environment for all your small scripts while learning to program. Python can create virtual environments with its built-in `venv` module. To create a virtual environment, **cd** to your *Scripts* folder and run **python –m venv .venv** (using python3 on macOS and Linux):
```bash
C:\Users\al>
C:\Users\al>cd Scripts
C:\Users\al\Scripts>python -m venv .venv
```
This creates the virtual environment’s files in a new folder named *.venv*. You can choose any folder name you want, but *.venv* is conventional. Files and folders whose names begin with a period are hidden, though there are steps you can follow to make your operating system show them by default.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you run `python` or `python3` from the terminal, you’ll still run your original Python installation’s interpreter. To use the virtual environment’s Python version, you must activate it. Do so by running the *C:\Users\al\Scripts\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat* script on Windows:
```bash
C:\Users\al\Scripts>cd .venv\Scripts
C:\Users\al\Scripts\.venv\Scripts>activate.bat
(.venv) C:\Users\al\Scripts\.venv\Scripts>where python.exe
C:\Users\Al\Scripts\.venv\Scripts\python.exe
C:\Users\Al\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe
C:\Users\Al\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe
```
Running `where python.exe` after activating the virtual environment shows that running python from the terminal will run the Python interpreter in the *.venv\Scripts* folder and not the system Python.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The equivalent script on macOS and Linux is *~/Scripts/.venv/bin/activate*, 
but due to security permissions, you can’t directly run it. Instead, run the command source activate:
```bash
al@al-virtual-machine:~/Scripts$ cd .venv/bin
al@al-virtual-machine:~/Scripts/.venv/bin$ source activate
(.venv) al@al-virtual-machine:~/Scripts/.venv/bin$ which python3
/home/al/Scripts/.venv/bin/python3
```
Activation changes the `PATH` environment variable so that `python` or `python3` runs the Python interpreter inside the *.venv* folder instead of the original one. It also changes your terminal prompt to include (.venv) so that you know the virtual environment is active. Running which `python3` in the activated virtual environment shows that `python3` runs the Python interpreter in the newly created *.venv/bin* folder. These changes apply to the current terminal window only; any existing or new terminal windows won’t have these environment variable or prompt changes. This fresh Python installation has only the default packages, and none of the packages you may have already installed in the original Python installation. You can confirm this by running **python –m pip list** to list the installed packages:
```bash
(.venv) C:\Users\al\Scripts\.venv\Scripts>python -m pip list
Package    Version
---------- ------
pip        23.0
setuptools 65.5.0
```
The standard practice is to create a virtual environment for each Python project you’re working on, since every project could have its own unique package dependencies. However, on Windows, we can be a bit more lax with the random small scripts we write in our *Scripts* folder: they can all share this one.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The macOS and Linux operating systems have their own programs that rely on the Python installation that comes with the operating system. Installing or updating packages for this original Python installation, called the *system Python*, has the slight chance of introducing incompatibilities that can cause these programs to fail. Running your own scripts with the system Python is fine; installing third-party packages to the system Python is slightly risky, but creating a virtual environment in your *Scripts* folder is a good precaution against installing incompatible packages.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To deactivate the virtual environment, run `deactivate.bat` (on Windows) or `source deactivate` (on macOS and Linux) in the same folder as the *activate* script. You can also simply close the terminal window and open a new one. If you want to permanently delete the virtual environment along with its installed packages, just delete the *.venv* folder and its contents.

### Installing Python Packages with Pip
Python comes with a command line package manager program called *pip* (written in lowercase unless it’s at the start of a sentence). Pip is a recursive acronym for *pip installs package*. While Python’s standard library comes with modules such as `sys`, `random`, and `os`, there are also hundreds of thousands of third-party packages you can find on *PyPI* (pronounced *pie-pee-eye* and not *pie-pie*), the Python Package Index, at *https://pypi.org*. In Python, a *package* is a collection of Python code made available on PyPI, and a *module* is an individual *.py* file containing Python code. You install packages from PyPI that contain modules, and you import modules with an *import* statement.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While pip is a program on its own, it’s easier to run it through the Python interpreter by running `python –m pip` on Windows or `python3 –m pip` on macOS and Linux, rather than running the `pip` (on Windows) or `pip3` (on macOS and Linux) program directly. This prevents errors in the rare cases where you have multiple Python installations, your `PATH` is misconfigured, and `pip/pip3` is installing to a different Python interpreter than the one that runs when you enter `python/python3`.

**NOTE: DON’T USE PIP WITH ANACONDA**  
If you’ve installed the Anaconda distribution of Python instead of the regular distribution from *https://python.org*, you should avoid using pip in your conda environments. Instead, use the conda-specific package manager through the `conda` command
