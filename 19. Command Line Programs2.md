### Virtual Environments
 Say you have two Python programs, one that uses version 1.0 of a package and another that uses version 2.0 of that same package. Python can’t have two versions of the same package installed at the same time. If version 2.0 is not backward compatible with version 1.0, you’d be uninstalling one version and reinstalling the other each time you wanted to switch programs to run.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Python’s solution to this problem is **virtual environments**; separate installations of Python that have their own set of installed third-party packages. In general, each Python application you create needs its own virtual environment. But you can use one virtual environment for all your small scripts while learning to program. Python can create virtual environments with its built-in `venv` module. To create a virtual environment, **cd** to your *Scripts* folder and run **python –m venv .venv** (using python3 on macOS and Linux):
```bash
C:\Users\al>
C:\Users\al>cd Scripts
C:\Users\al\Scripts>python -m venv .venv
```
This creates the virtual environment’s files in a new folder named *.venv*. You can choose any folder name you want, but *.venv* is conventional. Files and folders whose names begin with a period are hidden, though there are steps you can follow to make your operating system show them by default.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you run `python` or `python3` from the terminal, you’ll still run your original Python installation’s interpreter. To use the virtual environment’s Python version, you must activate it. Do so by running the *C:\Users\al\Scripts\.venv\Scripts\activate.bat* script on Windows:
```bash
C:\Users\al\Scripts>cd .venv\Scripts
C:\Users\al\Scripts\.venv\Scripts>activate.bat
(.venv) C:\Users\al\Scripts\.venv\Scripts>where python.exe
C:\Users\Al\Scripts\.venv\Scripts\python.exe
C:\Users\Al\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python313\python.exe
C:\Users\Al\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python312\python.exe
```
