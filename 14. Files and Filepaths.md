Variables are a fine way to store data while your program is running, but if you want your data to persist even after your program has finished, you need to save it to a file. You can think of a file’s contents as a single string value, potentially gigabytes in size.

## Files and Filepaths
A file has two key properties: a *filename* (usually written as one word) and a *path*. The path specifies the location of a file on the computer. For example, there is a file on my Windows laptop with the filename *project.docx* in the path 
*C:\Users\Tammy\Documents*. The part of the filename after the last period is called the file’s extension and tells you a file’s type. The filename *project.docx* is a Word document, and *Users*, *Tammy*, and *Documents* all refer to *folders* (also called *directories*). Folders can contain files and other folders (called *subfolders*). For example, *project.docx* is in the *Documents* folder, which is inside the *Tammy* folder, which is inside the *Users* folder.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The *C:\* part of the path is the *root folder*, which contains all the other folders. On Windows, the root folder is named *C:\* and is also called the *C:drive*. On macOS and Linux, the root folder is */*. For this note I’ll use the Windows-style root folder, *C:\*.
