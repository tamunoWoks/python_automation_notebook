## Qualifier Syntax: What Characters to Match
Regular expressions are split into two parts: the *qualifiers* that dictate what characters you are trying to match followed by the *quantifiers* that dictate how many characters you are trying to match. In the `r'\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}'` phone number regex string example we’ve been using, the `r'\d'` and `'-'` parts are qualifiers and the `'{3}'` and `'{4}'` are quantifiers. Let’s now examine the syntax of qualifiers.

### Using Character Classes and Negative Character Classes:
Although you can define a single character to match, as we’ve done in the previous examples, you can also define a set of characters to match inside square brackets. This set is called a *character class*. For example, the character class `[aeiouAEIOU]` will match any vowel, both lowercase and uppercase. It’s the equivalent of writing a|e|i|o|u|A|E|I|O|U, but it’s easier to type. For example:
```python
import re

vowel_pattern = re .compile(r'[aeiouAEIOU]')
vowel_pattern.findall('RoboCop eats BABY FOOD.')

# ['o', 'o', 'o', 'e', 'a', 'A', 'O', 'O']
```
