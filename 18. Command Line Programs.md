## DESIGNING AND DEPLOYING COMMAND LINE PROGRAMS
The command line is a more convenient way to execute Python scripts (especially if you share your programs with friends or co-workers who don’t have Python, installed). In software development, *deployment* is the process of making our software usable outside our code editors.

### A Program by Any Other Name:
Programming uses a lot of terms that mean *a program* or some slight variation of the term. You could accurately call all 
of the following items a program. But there are subtle differences between what these names mean:
- A **program** is a complete piece of software, large or small, with instructions that a computer carries out.
- A **script** is a program that an interpreter runs from its source-code form rather than from a compiled, machine-code form. This is a very loose term. Python programs are often called scripts even though Python code can be compiled like other languages.
- A **command** is a program that is often run from a text-based terminal and doesn’t have a graphical user interface (GUI). All configuration is done up front by specifying command line arguments before running the command (although *interactive commands* may sometimes interrupt their operation with an “Are you sure? Y/N” question for the user). 
- A **shell script** is a single text file that conveniently runs several bundled terminal commands in one batch. This way, a user can run one shell script instead of manually entering several commands individually. On macOS and Linux, shell script files have a *.sh* file extension (or no extension), while Windows uses the term *batch file* for shell scripts with a *.bat* file extension.
- An **application** is a program that has a GUI and contains multiple related features. Excel and Firefox are examples of applications. Applications usually have several files that an *installer* program sets up on your computer (and that an *uninstaller* program can remove), rather than consisting of just a single executable file copied to a computer. *App* 
is a common name for mobile phone and tablet applications, but the term can be used for desktop applications as well. A *web app* is a program that runs on a web server, and which users interact with over the internet through a web browser.

You’re welcome to nitpick about precise definitions; these explanations should merely give you a general sense of the terms’ usage.

### Using the Terminal:
Until the 1990s, when Apple and Microsoft popularized computers with GUIs that could run multiple programs simultaneously, programs were launched from a *command line interface* (CLI) and were often limited to text-based input and output. You might also hear CLIs called the *command prompt, terminal, shell,* or *console*. Software developers still make use of CLIs and often have several terminal windows open on their computers at any given time. While a text-based terminal might not have the icons, buttons, and graphics of a GUI, it’s an effective way to use a computer once you’ve learned several commands.  

To open a terminal window, do the following:
- On Windows, click the Start button (or press the Windows key) and enter Command Prompt (or PowerShell or Terminal if you have them installed).
- On macOS, click the Spotlight icon in the upper-right corner and enter Terminal.
- On Ubuntu Linux, press the Windows key to bring up Dash, and enter Terminal. Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut ctrl-alt-T.

Just as the interactive shell has a `>>>` prompt, the terminal will display a prompt for you to enter commands. On Windows, this will be the full path of the folder you are currently in, followed by an angle bracket (>):
```txt
C:\Users\al>your commands go here
```
On macOS, the prompt shows your username, your computer’s name, and the current working directory (with your home folder represented as ~ for short), followed by a percent sign (%):
```txt
al@Als-MacBook-Pro ~ % your commands go here
```
On Ubuntu Linux, the prompt is similar to the prompt in macOS, except it begins with the username and an @ sign:
```txt
al@al-VirtualBox:~$ your commands go here
```
While it’s easier to run programs from the Start menu (Windows) or Spotlight (macOS), it’s also possible to start them from the terminal. The Python interpreter itself is a program often run from the terminal.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henceforth, we’ll assume the Python program we want to run is named *yourScript.py* and that it’s located in a *Scripts* folder under your home folder. To run one of your *.py* Python files from the terminal, enter its filepath after `python` or `python3` either in its absolute form, like python C:\Users\al\Scripts\yourScript.py, or in its relative form, like python yourScript.py, if the current working directory is set to C:\Users\al\Scripts, the same folder that *yourScript.py* is in.
