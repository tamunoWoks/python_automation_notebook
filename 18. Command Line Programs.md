## DESIGNING AND DEPLOYING COMMAND LINE PROGRAMS
The command line is a more convenient way to execute Python scripts (especially if you share your programs with friends or co-workers who don’t have Python, installed). In software development, *deployment* is the process of making our software usable outside our code editors.

### A Program by Any Other Name
Programming uses a lot of terms that mean *a program* or some slight variation of the term. You could accurately call all 
of the following items a program. But there are subtle differences between what these names mean:
- A **program** is a complete piece of software, large or small, with instructions that a computer carries out.
- A **script** is a program that an interpreter runs from its source-code form rather than from a compiled, machine-code form. This is a very loose term. Python programs are often called scripts even though Python code can be compiled like other languages.
- A **command** is a program that is often run from a text-based terminal and doesn’t have a graphical user interface (GUI). All configuration is done up front by specifying command line arguments before running the command (although *interactive commands* may sometimes interrupt their operation with an “Are you sure? Y/N” question for the user). 
- A **shell script** is a single text file that conveniently runs several bundled terminal commands in one batch. This way, a user can run one shell script instead of manually entering several commands individually. On macOS and Linux, shell script files have a *.sh* file extension (or no extension), while Windows uses the term *batch file* for shell scripts with a *.bat* file extension.
- An **application** is a program that has a GUI and contains multiple related features. Excel and Firefox are examples of applications. Applications usually have several files that an *installer* program sets up on your computer (and that an *uninstaller* program can remove), rather than consisting of just a single executable file copied to a computer. *App* 
is a common name for mobile phone and tablet applications, but the term can be used for desktop applications as well. A *web app* is a program that runs on a web server, and which users interact with over the internet through a web browser.

You’re welcome to nitpick about precise definitions; these explanations should merely give you a general sense of the terms’ usage.
