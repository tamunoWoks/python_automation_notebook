## DESIGNING AND DEPLOYING COMMAND LINE PROGRAMS
The command line is a more convenient way to execute Python scripts (especially if you share your programs with friends or co-workers who don’t have Python, installed). In software development, *deployment* is the process of making our software usable outside our code editors.

### A Program by Any Other Name:
Programming uses a lot of terms that mean *a program* or some slight variation of the term. You could accurately call all 
of the following items a program. But there are subtle differences between what these names mean:
- A **program** is a complete piece of software, large or small, with instructions that a computer carries out.
- A **script** is a program that an interpreter runs from its source-code form rather than from a compiled, machine-code form. This is a very loose term. Python programs are often called scripts even though Python code can be compiled like other languages.
- A **command** is a program that is often run from a text-based terminal and doesn’t have a graphical user interface (GUI). All configuration is done up front by specifying command line arguments before running the command (although *interactive commands* may sometimes interrupt their operation with an “Are you sure? Y/N” question for the user). 
- A **shell script** is a single text file that conveniently runs several bundled terminal commands in one batch. This way, a user can run one shell script instead of manually entering several commands individually. On macOS and Linux, shell script files have a *.sh* file extension (or no extension), while Windows uses the term *batch file* for shell scripts with a *.bat* file extension.
- An **application** is a program that has a GUI and contains multiple related features. Excel and Firefox are examples of applications. Applications usually have several files that an *installer* program sets up on your computer (and that an *uninstaller* program can remove), rather than consisting of just a single executable file copied to a computer. *App* 
is a common name for mobile phone and tablet applications, but the term can be used for desktop applications as well. A *web app* is a program that runs on a web server, and which users interact with over the internet through a web browser.

You’re welcome to nitpick about precise definitions; these explanations should merely give you a general sense of the terms’ usage.

### Using the Terminal:
Until the 1990s, when Apple and Microsoft popularized computers with GUIs that could run multiple programs simultaneously, programs were launched from a *command line interface* (CLI) and were often limited to text-based input and output. You might also hear CLIs called the *command prompt, terminal, shell,* or *console*. Software developers still make use of CLIs and often have several terminal windows open on their computers at any given time. While a text-based terminal might not have the icons, buttons, and graphics of a GUI, it’s an effective way to use a computer once you’ve learned several commands.  

To open a terminal window, do the following:
- On Windows, click the Start button (or press the Windows key) and enter Command Prompt (or PowerShell or Terminal if you have them installed).
- On macOS, click the Spotlight icon in the upper-right corner and enter Terminal.
- On Ubuntu Linux, press the Windows key to bring up Dash, and enter Terminal. Alternatively, use the keyboard shortcut ctrl-alt-T.

Just as the interactive shell has a `>>>` prompt, the terminal will display a prompt for you to enter commands. On Windows, this will be the full path of the folder you are currently in, followed by an angle bracket (>):
```bash
C:\Users\al>your commands go here
```
On macOS, the prompt shows your username, your computer’s name, and the current working directory (with your home folder represented as ~ for short), followed by a percent sign (%):
```bash
al@Als-MacBook-Pro ~ % your commands go here
```
On Ubuntu Linux, the prompt is similar to the prompt in macOS, except it begins with the username and an @ sign:
```bash
al@al-VirtualBox:~$ your commands go here
```
While it’s easier to run programs from the Start menu (Windows) or Spotlight (macOS), it’s also possible to start them from the terminal. The Python interpreter itself is a program often run from the terminal.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Henceforth, we’ll assume the Python program we want to run is named *yourScript.py* and that it’s located in a *Scripts* folder under our home folder. To run one of your *.py* Python files from the terminal, enter its filepath after `python` or `python3` either in its absolute form, like python C:\Users\al\Scripts\yourScript.py, or in its relative form, like python yourScript.py, if the current working directory is set to C:\Users\al\Scripts, the same folder that *yourScript.py* is in.

### The cd, pwd, dir, and ls Commands
Just as all running programs have a current working directory (CWD) to which relative file paths are attached, the terminal too has a current working directory. You can see this CWD as part of the terminal prompt, or view it by running `pwd` (for *print working directory*) on macOS and Linux or the `cd` command, without any command line arguments, on Windows. 

#### 1. `cd` command:
Your Python programs can change the CWD by calling the `os.chdir()` function. In the terminal, you can do the same thing by entering the `cd` command followed by the relative or absolute filepath of the folder to change to:
```bash
C:\Users\al>cd Desktop
C:\Users\al\Desktop>cd ..
C:\Users\al>cd C:\Windows\System32
C:\Windows\System32>
```
On Windows, you may have the added step of needing to switch the drive letter. You can’t change the drive you are in with the `cd` command. Instead, enter the drive letter followed by a colon, then use `cd` to change directories on the drive:
```bash
C:\Windows\System32>D:
D:\>cd backup
D:\backup>
```
#### 2. `dir` & `ls` command:
The `dir` command on Windows and the `ls` command on macOS and Linux will list the file and subfolder contents of the CWD:
```bash
C:\Users\al>dir--snip-
08/26/2036  06:42 PM           171,304 _recursive-centaur.png
08/18/2035  11:25 AM             1,278 _viminfo
08/13/2035  12:58 AM    <DIR>          __pycache__
            77 File(s)     83,805,114 bytes
           108 Dir(s)  149,225,267,200 bytes free
```
While navigating the file system in the terminal, you’ll often bounce between `cd` to change directories and `dir/ls` to see the contents of the directory. You can list all the executable files in the CWD by running `dir *.exe` on Windows and `file * | grep executable` on macOS and Linux. Once you are in the folder containing a program, you can run it in the following ways:
- On Windows, enter the program name with or without the `.exe` extension: `example.exe`.
- On macOS and Linux, enter `./` followed by the program name: `./example`.  

Of course, you can always enter the full absolute path of a program: `C:\ full\path\to\example.exe` or `/full/path/to/example`.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to open a non-program file, such as a text file named *example.txt*, you can open it with its associated application by entering *example.txt* on Windows or open *example.txt* on macOS and Linux. This does, from the terminal, the same thing as double-clicking the *example.txt* file’s icon in a GUI. If there is no associated application set for *.txt* files, the operating system will prompt the user to select one and remember it for the future.

### The PATH Environment Variable:
All running programs, no matter the language they’re written in, have a set of string variables called *environment variables*. One of these is the `PATH` environment variable, which contains a list of folders the terminal checks when you enter the name of a program. For example, if you enter `python` on Windows or `python3` on macOS and Linux, the terminal checks for a program with that name in the folders listed in `PATH`. Operating systems have slightly different rules for how they use `PATH`:
- Windows first checks the CWD for a program of that name, then the folders in `PATH`.
- Linux and macOS check only the folders in `PATH` and don’t check the CWD at all. If you want to run a program named *example* in the CWD, you must enter `./example` rather than `example`.  

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To view the contents of the `PATH` environment variable, run echo `%PATH%` on Windows or echo `$PATH` on macOS and Linux. The value stored in `PATH` is a long string composed of folder names eparated by a semicolon (on Windows) or a colon (on macOS and Linux). For example, on Ubuntu Linux, the PATH environment variable may look like the following:
```bash
al@al-virtual-machine:~$ echo $PATH
/home/al/.local/bin:/home/al/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/
usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/usr/games:/usr/local/games:/snap/bin
```
If you were to enter `python3` into the Linux terminal with this `PATH`, Linux would check for a program named `python3` in the `/home/al/.local/bin` folder first, then in the `/home/al/bin` folder, and so on. It would eventually find `python3` in `/usr/bin` and run that. The `PATH` environment variable is convenient because you can just drop a program in a folder on the `PATH` to spare yourself from `cd-ing` to its folder every time you want to run it.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Note that the terminal window doesn’t search subfolders under a `PATH` folder. If `C:\Users\al\Scripts` is listed in the `PATH`, running `spam.exe` will run a `C:\Users\al\Scripts\spam.exe` file but not a `C:\Users\al\Scripts\eggs\spam.exe` file.

### PATH Editing:
It is recommended to create a Scripts folder under your home folder. If your username happens to be *al*, this folder would be:
- C:\Users\al\Scripts on Windows
- /Users/al/Scripts on macOS
- /home/al/Scripts on Ubuntu Linux.  

Let’s add this folder to the PATH.
