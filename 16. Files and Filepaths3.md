##  The File Reading and Writing Process
Once you’re comfortable working with folders and relative paths, you’ll be able to specify the locations of files to read and write. The functions covered in the next few sections apply to plaintext files. Plaintext files contain only basic text characters and do not include font, size, or color information. Text files with the `.txt` extension or Python script files with the `.py` extension are examples of plaintext files. You can open these with the Windows Notepad or macOS TextEdit application, and your programs can easily read their content, then treat it as an ordinary string value.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Binary files are all other file types, such as word processing documents, PDFs, images, spreadsheets, and executable programs. If you open a binary file in Notepad or TextEdit, it usually looks like scrambled nonsense.  

We must handle each type of binary file in its own way. Fortunately, many modules make working with binary files easier, and we’ll explore one of them, the `shelve` module later.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The `pathlib` module’s `read_text()` method returns the full contents of a text file as a string. Its `write_text()` method creates a new text file (or overwrites an existing one) with the string passed to it. For example:
```
from pathlib import Path

p = Path('spam.txt')

p.write_text('Hello, world!') # 13
p.read_text() # 'Hello, world!'
```
These method calls create a `spam.txt` file with the content `'Hello, world!'`. The 13 that `write_text()` returns indicates that 13 characters were written to the file. (You can often disregard this return value.) The `read_text()` call reads and returns the contents of the new file as a string: 'Hello, world!'.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep in mind that these `Path` object methods allow only basic interactions with files. The more common way of writing to a file involves using the `open()` function and file objects. There are three steps to reading or writing f iles in Python:
  1. Call the `open()` function to return a File object.
  2. Call the `read()` or `write()` method on the File object.
  3. Close the file by calling the `close()` method on the File object.  

Note that as you begin working with files, you may find it helpful to be able to quickly see their extensions (`.txt`, `.pdf`, `.jpg`, and so on). Windows and macOS may hide file extensions by default, showing `spam.txt` as simply `spam`. To show extensions, open the settings for File Explorer (on Windows) or Finder (on macOS) and look for a checkbox that says something like “Show all filename extensions” or “Hide extensions for known file types.” (The exact location and wording of this setting depend on the version of your operating system.

### Opening Files:
To open a file with the `open()` function, pass it a string path indicating the file you want to open. This can be either an absolute path or a relative path. The `open()` function returns a File object.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Try this by creating a text file named *hello.txt* using Notepad or TextEdit. Enter Hello, world! as the content of this text file and save it in your user home folder. Then, enter the following code:
```python
from pathlib import Path

hello_file = open(Path.home() / 'hello.txt', encoding='UTF-8')
```
The `open()` function will open the file in “reading plaintext” mode, or *read mode* for short. When a file is opened in read mode, Python lets you read the file’s data but not write or modify it in any way. Read mode is the default mode for files you open in Python. But if you don’t want to rely on Python’s defaults, you can explicitly specify the mode by passing the string value `'r'` as a second argument to `open` For example, `open('/Users/Al/ hello.txt', 'r')` does the same thing as open('/Users/Al/hello.txt').  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The encoding named parameter specifies what encoding to use when converting the bytes in the file to a Python text string. The correct encoding is almost always `'utf-8'`, which is also the default encoding used on macOS and Linux. However, Windows uses   'cp1252'   for its default encoding (also known as extended ASCII). This can cause problems when trying to read certain UTF-8 encoded text files with non-English characters on Windows, so it’s a good habit to pass `encoding='utf-8'` to your `open()` function calls when opening files in plaintext read, write, or append mode. The binary read, write, and append modes don’t use the encoding named parameter, so you can leave it out in those cases.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The call to `open()` returns a File object. A File object represents a file on your computer; it is simply another type of value in Python, much like the lists and dictionaries. In the previous example, we stored the File object in the variable `hello_file`. Now, whenever you we want to read from or write to the file, we can do so by calling methods on the File object in `hello_file`.

### Reading the Contents of Files:
Now that we have a File object, we can start reading from it. If you want to read the entire contents of a file as a string value, use the File object’s `read()` method. Let’s continue with the *hello.txt* File object you stored in `hello_file`. 
```python
hello_content = hello_file.read()
hello_content # 'Hello, world!'
```
You can think of the contents of a file as a single large string value; the `read()` method merely returns the string that is stored in the file. Alternatively, you can use the `readlines()` method to get a list of string values from the file, one for each line of text. For example, create a file named *sonnet29.txt* in the same directory as *hello.txt* and place the following text in it:
```txt
 When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,
 I all alone beweep my outcast state,
 And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,
 And look upon myself and curse my fate,
```
Make sure to separate the four lines with line breaks. Then, enter the following:
```python
sonnet_file = open(Path.home() / 'sonnet29.txt', encoding='UTF-8')
sonnet_file.readlines() # ["When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,\n", 'I all alone beweep my outcast state,\n', And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries,\n', 'And look upon myself and curse my fate,']
```
Note that, except for the last line of the file, each of the string values ends with a newline character `\n`. A list of strings is often easier to work with than a single large string value.
