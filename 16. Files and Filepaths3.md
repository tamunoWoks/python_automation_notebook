##  The File Reading and Writing Process
Once you’re comfortable working with folders and relative paths, you’ll be able to specify the locations of files to read and write. The functions covered in the next few sections apply to plaintext files. Plaintext files contain only basic text characters and do not include font, size, or color information. Text files with the `.txt` extension or Python script files with the `.py` extension are examples of plaintext files. You can open these with the Windows Notepad or macOS TextEdit application, and your programs can easily read their content, then treat it as an ordinary string value.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Binary files are all other file types, such as word processing documents, PDFs, images, spreadsheets, and executable programs. If you open a binary file in Notepad or TextEdit, it usually looks like scrambled nonsense.  

We must handle each type of binary file in its own way. Fortunately, many modules make working with binary files easier, and we’ll explore one of them, the `shelve` module later.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The `pathlib` module’s `read_text()` method returns the full contents of a text file as a string. Its `write_text()` method creates a new text file (or overwrites an existing one) with the string passed to it. For example:
```
from pathlib import Path

p = Path('spam.txt')

p.write_text('Hello, world!') # 13
p.read_text() # 'Hello, world!'
```
These method calls create a `spam.txt` file with the content `'Hello, world!'`. The 13 that `write_text()` returns indicates that 13 characters were written to the file. (You can often disregard this return value.) The `read_text()` call reads and returns the contents of the new file as a string: 'Hello, world!'.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep in mind that these `Path` object methods allow only basic interactions with files. The more common way of writing to a file involves using the `open()` function and file objects. There are three steps to reading or writing f iles in Python:
1. Call the open() function to return a File object.
2. Call the read() or write() method on the File object.
3. Close the file by calling the close() method on the File object.  

Note that as you begin working with files, you may find it helpful to be able to quickly see their extensions (`.txt`, `.pdf`, `.jpg`, and so on). Windows and macOS may hide file extensions by default, showing `spam.txt` as simply `spam`. To show extensions, open the settings for File Explorer (on Windows) or Finder (on macOS) and look for a checkbox that says something like “Show all filename extensions” or “Hide extensions for known file types.” (The exact location and wording of this setting depend on the version of your operating system.
