##  The File Reading and Writing Process
Once you’re comfortable working with folders and relative paths, you’ll be able to specify the locations of files to read and write. The functions covered in the next few sections apply to plaintext files. Plaintext files contain only basic text characters and do not include font, size, or color information. Text files with the `.txt` extension or Python script files with the `.py` extension are examples of plaintext files. You can open these with the Windows Notepad or macOS TextEdit application, and your programs can easily read their content, then treat it as an ordinary string value.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Binary files are all other file types, such as word processing documents, PDFs, images, spreadsheets, and executable programs. If you open a binary file in Notepad or TextEdit, it usually looks like scrambled nonsense.
