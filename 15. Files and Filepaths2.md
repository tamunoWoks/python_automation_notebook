### Specifying Absolute vs. Relative Paths
There are two ways to specify a filepath:
- An *absolute path*, which always begins with the root folder (C:\ on Windows and / on macOS and Linux)
- A *relative path*, which is relative to the program’s current working directory.

On Windows, `C:\` is the root for the main hard drive. This lettering dates back to the 1960s, when computers had two floppy disk drives labeled `A:\` and `B:\`. On Windows, USB flash memory and DVD drives are assigned to letters `D:\` and higher. Use one of these drives as the root folder to access files on that storage media.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also the *dot* (.) and *dot-dot* (..) folders. These are not real folders but special names that can be used in a filepath. A single period (dot) for a folder name is shorthand for *this folder*. Two periods (dot-dot) means the *parent folder*. The `.\` at the start of a relative path is optional. For example, `.\spam.txt` and `spam.txt` refer to the same file.

### Creating New Folders
Your programs can create new folders with the `os.makedirs()` function.  For example:
```python
import os
os.makedirs('C:\\delicious\\walnut\\waffles')
```
This will create not just the `C:\delicious` folder but also a `walnut` folder inside `C:\delicious` and a `waffles` folder inside `C:\delicious\walnut`. That is, `os.makedirs()` will create any necessary intermediate folders to ensure that the full path exists.  

To make a directory from a `Path` object, call the `mkdir()` method. For example, this code will create a spam folder under the home folder on my computer:
```python
from pathlib import Path
Path(r'C:\Users\Al\spam').mkdir()
```
Note that `mkdir()` can only make one directory at a time; it won’t make several subdirectories at once, like `os.makedirs()` will.

### Handling Absolute and Relative Paths
Calling the `is_absolute()` method on a `Path` object will return `True` if it represents an absolute path or `False` if it represents a relative path. For example, enter the following using your own files and folders instead of the exact ones listed here:
```python
from pathlib import Path

Path.cwd()
# WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/AppData/Local/Programs/Python/Python312')

Path.cwd().is_absolute()
# True

Path('spam/bacon/eggs').is_absolute()
# False
```
To get an absolute path from a relative path, you can put `Path.cwd() /` in front of the relative `Path` object. After all, when we say “relative path,” we almost always mean a path that is relative to the current working directory. 
The `absolute()` method also returns this `Path` object. For example:
```python
from pathlib import Path

Path('my/relative/path')
# WindowsPath('my/relative/path')

Path.cwd() / Path('my/relative/path')
# WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/Desktop/my/relative/path')

Path('my/relative/path').absolute()
# WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/Desktop/my/relative/path')
```
