### Specifying Absolute vs. Relative Paths
There are two ways to specify a filepath:
- An *absolute path*, which always begins with the root folder (C:\ on Windows and / on macOS and Linux)
- A *relative path*, which is relative to the program’s current working directory.

On Windows, `C:\` is the root for the main hard drive. This lettering dates back to the 1960s, when computers had two floppy disk drives labeled `A:\` and `B:\`. On Windows, USB flash memory and DVD drives are assigned to letters `D:\` and higher. Use one of these drives as the root folder to access files on that storage media.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are also the *dot* (.) and *dot-dot* (..) folders. These are not real folders but special names that can be used in a filepath. A single period (dot) for a folder name is shorthand for *this folder*. Two periods (dot-dot) means the *parent folder*.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The .\ at the start of a relative path is optional. For example, .\spam.txt 
and spam.txt refer to the same file.
