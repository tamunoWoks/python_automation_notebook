## Greedy and Non-greedy Matching
Because `(Ha){3,5}` can match three, four, or five instances of `Ha` in the string 'HaHaHaHaHa', you may wonder why the Match object’s call to `group()` in the previous curly bracket example returns 'HaHaHaHaHa' instead of the shorter possibilities. After all, 'HaHaHa' and 'HaHaHaHa' are also valid matches of the regular expression (Ha){3,5}.  

Python’s regular expressions are *greedy* by default, which means that in ambiguous situations, they will match the longest string possible. The *non-greedy* (also called lazy) version of the curly brackets, which matches the shortest string possible, must follow the closing curly bracket with a question mark.  

For example notice the difference between the greedy and non-greedy forms of the curly brackets searching the same string:
```python
import re

greedy_pattern = re .compile(r'(Ha){3,5}')
match1 = greedy_pattern.search('HaHaHaHaHa')
match1.group() # 'HaHaHaHaHa'

lazy_pattern = re .compile(r'(Ha){3,5} ?')
match2 = lazy_pattern.search('HaHaHaHaHa')
match2.group() # 'HaHaHa
```
**Note**
-  The question mark can have two meanings in regular expressions: declaring a lazy match or declaring an optional qualifier. These meanings are entirely unrelated.
-  It’s worth pointing out that, technically, you could get by without using the optional `?` quantifier, or even the `*` and `+` quantifiers:
    -  The ? quantifier is the same as {0,1}.
    - The * quantifier is the same as {0,}.
    - The + quantifier is the same as {1,}.  
However, the `?`, `*`, and `+` quantifiers are common shorthand.
