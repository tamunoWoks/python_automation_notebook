## Greedy and Non-greedy Matching
Because `(Ha){3,5}` can match three, four, or five instances of `Ha` in the string 'HaHaHaHaHa', you may wonder why the Match objectâ€™s call to `group()` in the previous curly bracket example returns 'HaHaHaHaHa' instead of the shorter possibilities. After all, 'HaHaHa' and 'HaHaHaHa' are also valid matches of the regular expression (Ha){3,5}.
