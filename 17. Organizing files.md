# Organizing Files
In addition to creating and writing to new files, your programs can organize preexisting files on the hard drive. Maybe you’ve had the experience of going through a folder full of dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of files and copying, renaming, moving, or compressing them all by hand. Or consider tasks such as these:
- Making copies of all PDF files (and only the PDF files) in every subfolder of a folder
- Removing the leading zeros in the filenames for every file in a folder of hundreds of files named `spam001.txt`, `spam002.txt`, `spam003.txt`, and so on.
- Compressing the contents of several folders into one ZIP file (which could serve as a simple backup system).  

All this is just begging to be automated in Python. By programming your computer to do these tasks, you can transform it into a 
quick-working file clerk that never makes mistakes.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Windows uses backslashes (\) to separate folders in a filepath,we will use forward slashes (/) instead, as they work on all operating systems.

## The `shutil` Module
The `shutil` module has functions to let you copy, move, rename, and delete files in your Python programs. (The module’s name is short for shell utilities, where *shell* is another term for a terminal command line.) To use the `shutil` functions, you’ll first need to run `import shutil`. Let's create an example file and folder to work with:
```python
from pathlib import Path
h = Path.home()
(h / 'spam').mkdir(exist_ok=True)
with open(h / 'spam/file1.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
     file.write('Hello')
```
This will create a folder named *spam* with a text file named *file1.txt*. All `shutil` functions can take filepath arguments that are either strings or `Path` objects.

#### Copying Files and Folders:
The `shutil` module provides functions for copying files, as well as entire folders. Calling `shutil.copy(source,destination)` will copy the file at the path *source* to the folder at the path *destination*. Both *source* and *destination* can be strings or `Path` objects. If *destination* is a filename, it will be used as the new name of the copied file. If *destination* is a folder, the file will be copied to that folder with its original name. This function returns the path of the copied file.
```python
import shutil
from pathlib import Path

h = Path.home()
shutil.copy(h / 'spam/file1.txt', h) # 'C:\\Users\\Al\\file1.txt'
shutil.copy(h / 'spam/file1.txt', h / 'spam/file2.txt') # WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/spam/file2.txt')
```
The first `shutil.copy()` call copies the file at `C:\Users\Al\spam\file1.txt` to the home folder `C:\Users\Al`. The return value is the path of the newly copied file. Note that since we specified a folder as the destination, the 
new, copied file will have the same filename as the original `file1.txt file`.  
The second `shutil.copy()` call copies the file at `C:\Users\Al\spam\file1.txt` to the `C:\Users\Al\spam` folder but gives the copied file the name `file2.txt`.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While `shutil.copy()` will copy a single file, calling `shutil.copytree(source, destination)` will copy the folder at the path source, along with all of its files and subfolders, to the folder at the path destination. The function returns the path of the copied folder.
```python
import shutil
from pathlib import Path

h = Path.home()
shutil.copytree(h / 'spam', h / 'spam_backup') # WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/spam_backup')
```
The `shutil.copytree()` call creates a new folder named *spam_backup* with the same content as the original `spam` folder.

#### Moving and Renaming Files and Folders:
Calling `shutil.move(source, destination)` will move the file or folder at the path *source* to the path *destination* and return a string of the new location’s absolute path. If *destination* points to a folder, the *source* file gets moved into *destination* and keeps its current filename. For example:
```python
import shutil
from pathlib import Path

h = Path.home()
(h / 'spam2').mkdir()
shutil.move(h / 'spam/file1.txt', h / 'spam2') # 'C:\\Users\\Al\\spam2\\file1.txt'
```
After creating the `spam2` folder in the home folder, this `shutil.move()` call says, “Move C:\Users\Al\spam\file1.txt into the folder C:\Users\Al\spam2.” If there had been a *file1.txt* file already in C:\Users\Al\spam2, Python would have raised an error.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the *destination* path is not an existing folder, `shutil.move()` will use this path to rename the file. In the following example, the *source* file is moved and renamed:
```python
shutil.move(h / 'spam/file1.txt', h / 'spam2/new_name.txt') # 'C:\\Users\\Al\\spam2\\new_name.txt'
```
This line says, “Move C:\Users\Al\spam\file1.txt into the folder C:\Users\Al\spam2, and while you’re at it, rename that *file1.txt* file to *new_name.txt*.”

#### Permanently Deleting Files and Folders:
You can delete a single file or a single empty folder with functions in the `os` module, whereas to delete a folder and all of its contents, you use the `shutil` module:
- Calling `shutil.rmtree(path)` will delete (that is, remove) the entire folder tree at path, including all the files and subfolders it contains.
- Calling `os.unlink(path)` will delete the single file at path.
- Calling `os.rmdir(path)` will delete the folder at path. This folder must be empty.  

Be careful when using these functions in your programs! It’s often a good idea to first run your program with these calls commented out and `print()` calls added to show the files that would be deleted. This is called a *dry run*. Here is a Python program that was intended to delete files with the *.txt* file extension, but it has a typo that causes it to delete *.rxt* files instead:
```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

for filename in Path.home().glob('*.rxt'):
    os.unlink(filename)
```
If you had any important files ending with *.rxt*, they would have been accidentally, permanently deleted. Instead, you should have first run the program like this:
```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

for filename in Path.home().glob('*.rxt'):
    #os.unlink(filename)
    print('Deleting', filename)
```
The `os.unlink()` call is now commented, so Python ignores it. Instead, you’ll print the filename of the file that would have been deleted. Running this version of the program first will show you that you’ve accidentally told the program to delete *.rxt* files instead of *.txt* files.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should also do dry runs for programs that copy, rename, or move files. Lastly, it may be a good idea to create a backup copy of the entire folder of any files your program touches, just in case you need to completely restore the original files. Once you’re certain the program works as intended, delete the `print(filename)` line and uncomment the `os.unlink(filename)` line. Then, run the program again to actually delete the files.

#### Deleting to the Recycle Bin:
Python’s built-in `shutil.rmtree()` function irreversibly deletes files and folders. This makes the function dangerous to use, because a bug could delete files you didn’t intend. A much better way to delete files and folders is with the third-party `send2trash` module.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the `send2trash` module’s `send2trash()` function is much safer than Python’s regular delete functions, because it will send folders and files to your computer’s trash or recycling bin instead of permanently deleting them. If a bug in your program deletes something with `send2trash` that you didn’t intend to delete, you can later restore it from the recycle bin.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After you have installed `send2trash`, enter the following to send the file *file1.txt* to the recycle bin:
```python
import send2trash
send2trash.send2trash('file1.txt')
```
In general, you should use the `send2trash.send2trash()` function to delete files and folders. But while sending files to the recycle bin lets you recover them later, it will not free up disk space like permanently deleting them does. Note that the `send2trash()` function can only send files to the recycle bin; it cannot pull files out of it.

## Walking a Directory Tree
If you want to list all the files and subfolders in a folder, call the `os.listdir()` function and pass it a folder name:
```python
import os

os.listdir(r'C:\Users\Al') # ['.anaconda', '.android', '.cache', '.dotnet', '.eclipse', '.gitconfig',--snip-',__pycache__']
```
You can also get a list of `Path` objects in a folder by calling the `iterdir()` method:
```python
from pathlib import Path

home = Path.home()
list(home.iterdir()) # [WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/.anaconda'), WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/.android'),
                         WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/.cache'),--snip-, WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/__pycache__')]
```
