# Organizing Files
In addition to creating and writing to new files, your programs can organize preexisting files on the hard drive. Maybe you’ve had the experience of going through a folder full of dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of files and copying, renaming, moving, or compressing them all by hand. Or consider tasks such as these:
- Making copies of all PDF files (and only the PDF files) in every subfolder of a folder
- Removing the leading zeros in the filenames for every file in a folder of hundreds of files named `spam001.txt`, `spam002.txt`, `spam003.txt`, and so on.
- Compressing the contents of several folders into one ZIP file (which could serve as a simple backup system).  

All this is just begging to be automated in Python. By programming your computer to do these tasks, you can transform it into a 
quick-working file clerk that never makes mistakes.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Windows uses backslashes (\) to separate folders in a filepath,we will use forward slashes (/) instead, as they work on all operating systems.

## The `shutil` Module
The `shutil` module has functions to let you copy, move, rename, and delete files in your Python programs. (The module’s name is short for shell utilities, where *shell* is another term for a terminal command line.) To use the `shutil` functions, you’ll first need to run `import shutil`. Let's create an example file and folder to work with:
```python
from pathlib import Path
h = Path.home()
(h / 'spam').mkdir(exist_ok=True)
with open(h / 'spam/file1.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
     file.write('Hello')
```
This will create a folder named *spam* with a text file named *file1.txt*. All `shutil` functions can take filepath arguments that are either strings or `Path` objects.
