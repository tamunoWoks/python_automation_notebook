# Organizing Files
In addition to creating and writing to new files, your programs can organize preexisting files on the hard drive. Maybe you’ve had the experience of going through a folder full of dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of files and copying, renaming, moving, or compressing them all by hand. Or consider tasks such as these:
- Making copies of all PDF files (and only the PDF files) in every subfolder of a folder
- Removing the leading zeros in the filenames for every file in a folder of hundreds of files named `spam001.txt`, `spam002.txt`, `spam003.txt`, and so on.
- Compressing the contents of several folders into one ZIP file (which could serve as a simple backup system).  

All this is just begging to be automated in Python. By programming your computer to do these tasks, you can transform it into a 
quick-working file clerk that never makes mistakes.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Windows uses backslashes (\) to separate folders in a filepath,we will use forward slashes (/) instead, as they work on all operating systems.

## The `shutil` Module
The `shutil` module has functions to let you copy, move, rename, and delete files in your Python programs. (The module’s name is short for shell utilities, where *shell* is another term for a terminal command line.) To use the `shutil` functions, you’ll first need to run `import shutil`. Let's create an example file and folder to work with:
```python
from pathlib import Path
h = Path.home()
(h / 'spam').mkdir(exist_ok=True)
with open(h / 'spam/file1.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
     file.write('Hello')
```
This will create a folder named *spam* with a text file named *file1.txt*. All `shutil` functions can take filepath arguments that are either strings or `Path` objects.

#### Copying Files and Folders:
The `shutil` module provides functions for copying files, as well as entire folders. Calling `shutil.copy(source,destination)` will copy the file at the path *source* to the folder at the path *destination*. Both *source* and *destination* can be strings or `Path` objects. If *destination* is a filename, it will be used as the new name of the copied file. If *destination* is a folder, the file will be copied to that folder with its original name. This function returns the path of the copied file.
```python
import shutil
from pathlib import Path

h = Path.home()
shutil.copy(h / 'spam/file1.txt', h) # 'C:\\Users\\Al\\file1.txt'
shutil.copy(h / 'spam/file1.txt', h / 'spam/file2.txt') # WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/spam/file2.txt')
```
The first `shutil.copy()` call copies the file at `C:\Users\Al\spam\file1.txt` to the home folder `C:\Users\Al`. The return value is the path of the newly copied file. Note that since we specified a folder as the destination, the 
new, copied file will have the same filename as the original `file1.txt file`.  
The second `shutil.copy()` call copies the file at `C:\Users\Al\spam\file1.txt` to the `C:\Users\Al\spam` folder but gives the copied file the name `file2.txt`.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While `shutil.copy()` will copy a single file, calling `shutil.copytree(source, destination)` will copy the folder at the path source, along with all of its files and subfolders, to the folder at the path destination. The function returns the path of the copied folder.
```python
import shutil
from pathlib import Path

h = Path.home()
shutil.copytree(h / 'spam', h / 'spam_backup') # WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/spam_backup')
```
The `shutil.copytree()` call creates a new folder named *spam_backup* with the same content as the original `spam` folder.

#### Moving and Renaming Files and Folders:
Calling `shutil.move(source, destination)` will move the file or folder at the path *source* to the path *destination* and return a string of the new location’s absolute path. If *destination* points to a folder, the *source* file gets moved into *destination* and keeps its current filename. For example:
```python
import shutil
from pathlib import Path

h = Path.home()
(h / 'spam2').mkdir()
shutil.move(h / 'spam/file1.txt', h / 'spam2') # 'C:\\Users\\Al\\spam2\\file1.txt'
```
After creating the `spam2` folder in the home folder, this `shutil.move()` call says, “Move C:\Users\Al\spam\file1.txt into the folder C:\Users\Al\spam2.” If there had been a *file1.txt* file already in C:\Users\Al\spam2, Python would have raised an error.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the *destination* path is not an existing folder, `shutil.move()` will use this path to rename the file. In the following example, the *source* file is moved and renamed:
```python
shutil.move(h / 'spam/file1.txt', h / 'spam2/new_name.txt') # 'C:\\Users\\Al\\spam2\\new_name.txt'
```
This line says, “Move C:\Users\Al\spam\file1.txt into the folder C:\Users\Al\spam2, and while you’re at it, rename that *file1.txt* file to *new_name.txt*.”

#### Permanently Deleting Files and Folders:
You can delete a single file or a single empty folder with functions in the `os` module, whereas to delete a folder and all of its contents, you use the `shutil` module:
- Calling `shutil.rmtree(path)` will delete (that is, remove) the entire folder tree at path, including all the files and subfolders it contains.
- Calling `os.unlink(path)` will delete the single file at path.
- Calling `os.rmdir(path)` will delete the folder at path. This folder must be empty.  

Be careful when using these functions in your programs! It’s often a good idea to first run your program with these calls commented out and `print()` calls added to show the files that would be deleted. This is called a *dry run*. Here is a Python program that was intended to delete files with the *.txt* file extension, but it has a typo that causes it to delete *.rxt* files instead:
```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

for filename in Path.home().glob('*.rxt'):
    os.unlink(filename)
```
If you had any important files ending with *.rxt*, they would have been accidentally, permanently deleted. Instead, you should have first run the program like this:
```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

for filename in Path.home().glob('*.rxt'):
    #os.unlink(filename)
    print('Deleting', filename)
```
The `os.unlink()` call is now commented, so Python ignores it. Instead, you’ll print the filename of the file that would have been deleted. Running this version of the program first will show you that you’ve accidentally told the program to delete *.rxt* files instead of *.txt* files.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should also do dry runs for programs that copy, rename, or move files. Lastly, it may be a good idea to create a backup copy of the entire folder of any files your program touches, just in case you need to completely restore the original files. Once you’re certain the program works as intended, delete the `print(filename)` line and uncomment the `os.unlink(filename)` line. Then, run the program again to actually delete the files.

#### Deleting to the Recycle Bin:
Python’s built-in `shutil.rmtree()` function irreversibly deletes files and folders. This makes the function dangerous to use, because a bug could delete files you didn’t intend. A much better way to delete files and folders is with the third-party `send2trash` module.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Using the `send2trash` module’s `send2trash()` function is much safer than Python’s regular delete functions, because it will send folders and files to your computer’s trash or recycling bin instead of permanently deleting them. If a bug in your program deletes something with `send2trash` that you didn’t intend to delete, you can later restore it from the recycle bin.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After you have installed `send2trash`, enter the following to send the file *file1.txt* to the recycle bin:
```python
import send2trash
send2trash.send2trash('file1.txt')
```
In general, you should use the `send2trash.send2trash()` function to delete files and folders. But while sending files to the recycle bin lets you recover them later, it will not free up disk space like permanently deleting them does. Note that the `send2trash()` function can only send files to the recycle bin; it cannot pull files out of it.

## Walking a Directory Tree
If you want to list all the files and subfolders in a folder, call the `os.listdir()` function and pass it a folder name:
```python
import os

os.listdir(r'C:\Users\Al') # ['.anaconda', '.android', '.cache', '.dotnet', '.eclipse', '.gitconfig',--snip-',__pycache__']
```
You can also get a list of `Path` objects in a folder by calling the `iterdir()` method:
```python
from pathlib import Path

home = Path.home()
list(home.iterdir()) # [WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/.anaconda'), WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/.android'),
                         WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/.cache'),--snip-, WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/__pycache__')]
```
Say you want to rename every file in some folder, and also every file in every subfolder of that folder. That is, you want to walk through the directory tree, accessing each file as you go. Writing a program to do this could get tricky; fortunately, Python provides the `os.walk()` function to handle this process for you.  
Let’s create a series of folders and files by running the following code:
```python
from pathlib import Path

h = Path.home()
(h / 'spam').mkdir(exist_ok=True)
(h / 'spam/eggs').mkdir(exist_ok=True)
(h / 'spam/eggs2').mkdir(exist_ok=True)
(h / 'spam/eggs/bacon').mkdir(exist_ok=True)

for f in ['spam/file1.txt', 'spam/eggs/file2.txt', 'spam/eggs/file3.txt', 'spam/eggs/bacon/file4.txt']:    
     with open(h / f, 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:        
          file.write('Hello')

# At this point, the folders and files now exist.
```
This code will create the following folders and files in your home folder:
- The *spam* folder
- The *spam/file1.txt* file
- The *spam/eggs* folder
- The *spam/eggs/file2.txt* file
- The *spam/eggs/file3.txt* file
- The *spam/eggs2* folder
- The *spam/eggs/bacon* folder
- The *spam/eggs/bacon/file4.txt* file.  

Here is an example program that uses the `os.walk()` function on this tree of folders and renames each file to uppercase letters:
```python
import os, shutil
from pathlib import Path

h = Path.home()
for folder_name, subfolders, filenames in os.walk(h / 'spam'):
    print('The current folder is ' + folder_name)

    for subfolder in subfolders:
        print('SUBFOLDER OF ' + folder_name + ': ' + subfolder)

    for filename in filenames:
        print('FILE INSIDE ' + folder_name + ': '+ filename)
        # Rename file to uppercase:
        p = Path(folder_name)
        shutil.move(p / filename, p / filename.upper())

    print('')
```
The `os.walk()` function gets passed a single string value: the path of a folder. You can use `os.walk()` in a for loop to walk a directory tree, much like how you can use the `range()` function to walk over a range of numbers.  

Unlike `range()`, the `os.walk()` function will return three values on each iteration through the loop:
- A string of the current folder’s name
- A list of strings of the subfolders in the current folder
- A list of strings of the files in the current folder.  

The current folder here refers to the folder accessed in the current iteration of the for loop. The `os.walk()` function doesn’t change the current working directory of the program. Just as you can choose the variable name `i` in the code for `i in range(10):`, you can also choose the variable names for the three values listed earlier. I always use the descriptive names `folder_name`, `subfolders`, and `filenames`.  

When I ran this program on my computer, it gave the following output:
```txt
The current folder is C:\Users\Al\spam
SUBFOLDER OF C:\Users\Al\spam: eggs
SUBFOLDER OF C:\Users\Al\spam: eggs2
FILE INSIDE C:\Users\Al\spam: file1.txt

The current folder is C:\Users\Al\spam\eggs
SUBFOLDER OF C:\Users\Al\spam\eggs: bacon
FILE INSIDE C:\Users\Al\spam\eggs: file2.txt
FILE INSIDE C:\Users\Al\spam\eggs: file3.txt

The current folder is C:\Users\Al\spam\eggs\bacon
FILE INSIDE C:\Users\Al\spam\eggs\bacon: file4.txt

The current folder is C:\Users\Al\spam\eggs2
```
Because `os.walk()` returns lists of strings for the `subfolder` and `filename` variables, you can use the return values in their own for loops. For instance, you can pass the folder and filename to functions like `shutil.move()`, as in the example.

## Compressing Files with the `zipfile` Module
You may be familiar with ZIP files (with the *.zip* file extension), which can hold the compressed contents of many other files. Compressing a file reduces its size, which is useful when transferring it over the internet. And since a ZIP file can also contain multiple files and subfolders, it’s a handy way to package several files into one. This single file, called an *archive file*, can then be, say, attached to an email.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your Python programs can create or extract from ZIP files using functions in the `zipfile` module.

#### Creating and Adding to ZIP Files:
To create your own compressed ZIP files, you must open the `ZipFile` object in write mode by passing `'w'` as the second argument. (Note the capital letters *Z* and *F* in the object name, which differs from the `zipfile` module name.) This 
process is similar to opening a text file in write mode by passing `'w'` to the `open()` function. For the filename, you can pass either a string or a `Path` object.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you pass a path to the `write()` method of a `ZipFile object`, Python will compress the file at that path and add it into the ZIP file. The `write()` method’s first argument is a string of the filename to add. The second argument is the *compression type* parameter, which tells the computer what algorithm it should use to compress the files; you can always set this value to `zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED` to specify the deflate compression algorithm, which works well on all types of data. If you don’t pass this value, the `write()` method adds the file to the ZIP file with its regular, uncompressed size. For example:
```python
import zipfile

with open('file1.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file_obj: 
     file_obj.write('Hello' * 10000)

with zipfile.ZipFile('example.zip', 'w') as example_zip:
     example_zip.write('file1.txt', compress_type=zipfile.ZIP_DEFLATED, compresslevel=9)
```
This code creates a text file named *file1.txt* and writes to it the 50,000-character string `'Hello' * 10000` (about 49KB). Then, it creates a new ZIP file named *example.zip* that has the compressed contents of *file1.txt* (about 213 bytes; highly repetitive data is also highly compressible). The `compresslevel` keyword argument (added in Python 3.7 and later) can be set to any value from `0` to `9`, with `9` being the slowest but most compressed level. If you don’t specify this keyword argument, the default is `6`.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The `zipfile.ZipFile()` function opens a ZIP file in a `with` statement, in a manner similar to how the `open()` function opens files. This ensures that the `close()` method is automatically called when the execution leaves the with statement’s block.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Keep in mind that, just as with writing to files, write mode will erase all existing contents of a ZIP file. If you want to simply add files to an existing ZIP file, pass `'a'` as the second argument to `zipfile.ZipFile()` to open the ZIP file in *append mode*.

#### Reading ZIP Files:
To read the contents of a ZIP file, you must first create a `ZipFile` object by calling the `zipfile.ZipFile()` function and passing the ZIP file’s filename. Note that `zipfile` is the name of the Python module, and `ZipFile()` is the name of the function. For example:
```python
import zipfile

example_zip = zipfile.ZipFile('example.zip')
example_zip.namelist() # ['file1.txt']

file1_info = example_zip.getinfo('file1.txt')
file1_info.file_size # 50000
file1_info .compress_size # 97

f'Compressed file is {round(file1_info.file_size / file1_info.compress _size, 2)}x smaller!'
# 'Compressed file is 515.46x smaller!'

example_zip.close()
```
A `ZipFile` object has a `namelist()` method that returns a list of strings for all the files and folders contained in the ZIP file. These strings can be passed to the `getinfo() ZipFile` method to return a `ZipInfo` object about that particular file. `ZipInfo` objects have their own attributes, such as `file_size` and `compress_size`, which hold integers representing the original file size and compressed file size, respectively, in bytes. While a `ZipFile` object represents an entire archive file, a `ZipInfo` object holds useful information about a single file in the archive.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The `f'Compressed file is {round(file1_info.file_size / file1_info.compress _size, 2)}x smaller!'` command calculates how efficiently `example.zip` is compressed by dividing the original file size by the compressed file size, then prints this information.

#### Extracting from ZIP Files:
The `extractall()` method for `ZipFile` objects extracts all the files and folders from a ZIP file into the current working directory. Create a ZIP file named `example.zip` and then enter the following:
```python
import zipfile

example_zip = zipfile.ZipFile('example.zip')
example_zip.extractall()
example_zip.close()
```
After running this code, Python will extract the contents of `example.zip` to the current working directory. Optionally, you can pass a folder name to `extractall()` to have it extract the files into a folder other than the current working directory. If the folder passed to the `extractall()` method doesn’t exist, Python will create it. For instance, if you replaced `example_zip.extractall()` with `example_zip.extractall('C:\\spam)`, the code would extract the files from `example.zip` into a newly created C:\spam folder.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The `extract()` method for `ZipFile` objects will extract a single file from the ZIP file. Continue the example by entering the following:
```python
example_zip.extract('file1.txt') # 'C:\\Users\\Al\\Desktop\\file1.txt'
example_zip.extract('file1.txt', 'C:\\some\\new\\folders') # 'C:\\some\\new\\folders\\file1.txt'
example_zip.close()
```
The string you pass to `extract()` must match one of the strings in the list returned by `namelist()`. Optionally, you can pass a second argument to `extract()` to extract the file into a folder other than the current working directory. If this second argument is a folder that doesn’t yet exist, Python will create the folder.
