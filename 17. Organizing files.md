# Organizing Files
In addition to creating and writing to new files, your programs can organize preexisting files on the hard drive. Maybe you’ve had the experience of going through a folder full of dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of files and copying, renaming, moving, or compressing them all by hand. Or consider tasks such as these:
- Making copies of all PDF files (and only the PDF files) in every subfolder of a folder
- Removing the leading zeros in the filenames for every file in a folder of hundreds of files named `spam001.txt`, `spam002.txt`, `spam003.txt`, and so on.
- Compressing the contents of several folders into one ZIP file (which could serve as a simple backup system).  

All this is just begging to be automated in Python. By programming your computer to do these tasks, you can transform it into a 
quick-working file clerk that never makes mistakes.  

While Windows uses backslashes (\) to separate folders in a filepath,we will use forward slashes (/) instead, as they work on all operating systems.
