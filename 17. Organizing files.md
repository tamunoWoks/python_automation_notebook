# Organizing Files
In addition to creating and writing to new files, your programs can organize preexisting files on the hard drive. Maybe you’ve had the experience of going through a folder full of dozens, hundreds, or even thousands of files and copying, renaming, moving, or compressing them all by hand. Or consider tasks such as these:
- Making copies of all PDF files (and only the PDF files) in every subfolder of a folder
- Removing the leading zeros in the filenames for every file in a folder of hundreds of files named `spam001.txt`, `spam002.txt`, `spam003.txt`, and so on.
- Compressing the contents of several folders into one ZIP file (which could serve as a simple backup system).  

All this is just begging to be automated in Python. By programming your computer to do these tasks, you can transform it into a 
quick-working file clerk that never makes mistakes.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While Windows uses backslashes (\) to separate folders in a filepath,we will use forward slashes (/) instead, as they work on all operating systems.

## The `shutil` Module
The `shutil` module has functions to let you copy, move, rename, and delete files in your Python programs. (The module’s name is short for shell utilities, where *shell* is another term for a terminal command line.) To use the `shutil` functions, you’ll first need to run `import shutil`. Let's create an example file and folder to work with:
```python
from pathlib import Path
h = Path.home()
(h / 'spam').mkdir(exist_ok=True)
with open(h / 'spam/file1.txt', 'w', encoding='utf-8') as file:
     file.write('Hello')
```
This will create a folder named *spam* with a text file named *file1.txt*. All `shutil` functions can take filepath arguments that are either strings or `Path` objects.

###  Copying Files and Folders:
The `shutil` module provides functions for copying files, as well as entire folders. Calling `shutil.copy(source,destination)` will copy the file at the path *source* to the folder at the path *destination*. Both *source* and *destination* can be strings or `Path` objects. If *destination* is a filename, it will be used as the new name of the copied file. If *destination* is a folder, the file will be copied to that folder with its original name. This function returns the path of the copied file.
```python
import shutil
from pathlib import Path

h = Path.home()
shutil.copy(h / 'spam/file1.txt', h) # 'C:\\Users\\Al\\file1.txt'
shutil.copy(h / 'spam/file1.txt', h / 'spam/file2.txt') # WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/spam/file2.txt')
```
The first `shutil.copy()` call copies the file at `C:\Users\Al\spam\file1.txt` to the home folder `C:\Users\Al`. The return value is the path of the newly copied file. Note that since we specified a folder as the destination, the 
new, copied file will have the same filename as the original `file1.txt file`.  
The second `shutil.copy()` call copies the file at `C:\Users\Al\spam\file1.txt` to the `C:\Users\Al\spam` folder but gives the copied file the name `file2.txt`.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While `shutil.copy()` will copy a single file, calling `shutil.copytree(source, destination)` will copy the folder at the path source, along with all of its files and subfolders, to the folder at the path destination. The function returns the path of the copied folder.
```python
import shutil
from pathlib import Path

h = Path.home()
shutil.copytree(h / 'spam', h / 'spam_backup') # WindowsPath('C:/Users/Al/spam_backup')
```
The `shutil.copytree()` call creates a new folder named *spam_backup* with the same content as the original `spam` folder.
