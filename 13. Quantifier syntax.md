##  Quantifier Syntax: How Many Qualifiers to Match
In a regular expression string, quantifiers follow qualifier characters to dictate how many of them to match. For example, in the phone number regex considered earlier, the `{3}` follows the `\d` to match exactly three digits.  

If there is no quantifier following a qualifier, the qualifier must appear exactly once: you can think of `r'\d'` as being the same as `r'\d{1}'`
