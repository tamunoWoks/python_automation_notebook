##  Quantifier Syntax: How Many Qualifiers to Match
In a regular expression string, quantifiers follow qualifier characters to dictate how many of them to match. For example, in the phone number regex considered earlier, the `{3}` follows the `\d` to match exactly three digits.  

If there is no quantifier following a qualifier, the qualifier must appear exactly once: you can think of `r'\d'` as being the same as `r'\d{1}'`

### Matching an Optional Pattern:
Sometimes you may want to match a pattern only optionally. That is, the regex should match zero or one of the preceding qualifiers. The `?` character flags the preceding qualifier as optional. For example:
```python
import re

pattern = re .compile(r'42! ?')

pattern.search('42!')
<re.Match object; span=(0, 3), match='42!'>

pattern.search('42')
<re.Match object; span=(0, 2), match='42'>
```
The `?` part of the regular expression means that the pattern `!` is optional. So it matches both `42!` (with the exclamation mark) and `42` (without it). The `?` question mark has meaning in regex syntax, but the `!` exclamation mark doesnâ€™t. So `r'42!?'` means `'42'` optionally followed by a `'!'`, but `r'42?!'` means `'4'` optionally followed by `'2'` followed by `'!'`:
```python
import re

pattern = re .compile(r'42 ?!')

pattern.search('42!')
<re.Match object; span=(0, 3), match='42!'>

pattern.search('4!')
<re.Match object; span=(0, 2), match='4!'>

pattern.search('42') == None  # No match
True
```
To make multiple characters optional, place them in a group and put the `?` after the group. In the earlier phone number example, you can use `?` to make the regex look for phone numbers that either do or do not have an area code.
