## Understanding HTML
HTML is the format in which web pages are written, while Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are a way to make categorical changes to the look of HTML elements in a web page. In this section, we’ll learn how to access your web browser’s powerful Developer Tools, which make scraping information from the web much easier.

### Exploring the Format:
An HTML file is a plaintext file with the *.html* file extension. The text in these files is surrounded by HTML *tags*, which are words enclosed in angle brackets (<>). The tags tell the browser how to format the web page. A starting tag and closing tag can enclose some text to form an HTML *element*. The text to display is the content between the starting and closing tags. For 
example, the following HTML will display **`Hello`**`, world!` in the browser, with *Hello* in bold:
```html
<b>Hello</b>, world!
```
