## Understanding HTML
HTML is the format in which web pages are written, while Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are a way to make categorical changes to the look of HTML elements in a web page. In this section, we’ll learn how to access your web browser’s powerful Developer Tools, which make scraping information from the web much easier.

### Exploring the Format:
An HTML file is a plaintext file with the *.html* file extension. The text in these files is surrounded by HTML *tags*, which are words enclosed in angle brackets (<>). The tags tell the browser how to format the web page. A starting tag and closing tag can enclose some text to form an HTML *element*. The text to display is the content between the starting and closing tags. For 
example, the following HTML will display **`Hello`**`, world!` in the browser, with *Hello* in bold:
```html
<b>Hello</b>, world!
```
The opening <b> tag says that the enclosed text will appear in bold. The closing </b> tag tells the browser where the end of the bold text is. Together, they form an element: `<b>Hello</b>`.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many different tags in HTML. Some of these tags have extra properties in the form of *attributes* within the angle brackets. For example, the `<a>` tag encloses text that should be a link, and the `href` attribute determines what URL to link to. Here’s an example:
```html
<a href ="https://inventwithpython.com">This text is a link</a>
```
Some elements have an `id` attribute used to uniquely identify the element in the page. You’ll often instruct your programs to seek out an element by its `id` attribute, so finding this attribute using the browser’s Developer Tools is a common task when writing web scraping programs.

### Viewing a Web Page’s Source:
You’ll need to look at the HTML of the web pages your programs will work with, called the *source*. To do this, right-click any web page in your web browser (or ctrl-click it on macOS), and select **View Source** or **View page source**. The source is the text your browser actually receives. The browser knows how to display, or _render_, the web page from this HTML.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You won’t need HTML mastery to write simple web scraping programs. You just need enough knowledge to pick out data from an existing site.

### Opening Your Browser’s Developer Tools:
In addition to viewing a web page’s source, you can look through a page’s HTML using your browser’s Developer Tools. In Firefox, Chrome, and Microsoft Edge, you can press F12 to make the tools appear. Pressing F12 again will make them disappear.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After enabling or installing the Developer Tools in your browser, right click any part of the web page and select **Inspect Element** from the context menu to bring up the HTML responsible for that part of the page. This will help you parse HTML for your web scraping programs.

#### NOTE: DON’T USE REGULAR EXPRESSIONS TO PARSE HTML
Locating a specific piece of HTML (or a piece of XML, JSON, TOML, or YAML) in a string seems like a perfect case for regular expressions . However, I advise you not to do this . HTML can be formatted in many ways and still be considered valid, but trying to capture all these possible variations in a regular expression is tedious and error prone . Using a module developed specifically for parsing HTML, such as `bs4`, is less likely to result in bugs.

### Finding HTML Elements:
Once your program has downloaded a web page using the requests module, you’ll have the page’s HTML content as a single string value. Now you need to figure out which part of the HTML corresponds to the information on the web page you’re interested in.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is where the browser’s Developer Tools can help. Say you want to write a program to pull weather forecast data from _https://weather.gov_. Before writing any code, do a little research. If you visit the site and search for the 94105 ZIP code, it should take you to a page showing the forecast for that area.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if you’re interested in scraping the weather information for that ZIP code? Right-click that information on the page (or ctrl-click on macOS) and select **Inspect Element** from the context menu that appears. This brings up the Developer Tools window, which shows you the HTML that produces that particular part of the web page. Note that if the _https://weather.gov_ site changes the design of its web pages, you’ll need to repeat this process to inspect the new elements.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the Developer Tools, you can see that the HTML responsible for the forecast part of a web page as thus:
```html
<div class="col-sm-10 forecast-text">Sunny, with a high near 64. West wind 11 to 16 mph, with gusts as high as 21 mph.</div>
```
