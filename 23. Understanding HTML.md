## Understanding HTML
HTML is the format in which web pages are written, while Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) are a way to make categorical changes to the look of HTML elements in a web page. In this section, we’ll learn how to access your web browser’s powerful Developer Tools, which make scraping information from the web much easier.

### Exploring the Format:
An HTML file is a plaintext file with the *.html* file extension. The text in these files is surrounded by HTML *tags*, which are words enclosed in angle brackets (<>). The tags tell the browser how to format the web page. A starting tag and closing tag can enclose some text to form an HTML *element*. The text to display is the content between the starting and closing tags. For 
example, the following HTML will display **`Hello`**`, world!` in the browser, with *Hello* in bold:
```html
<b>Hello</b>, world!
```
The opening <b> tag says that the enclosed text will appear in bold. The closing </b> tag tells the browser where the end of the bold text is. Together, they form an element: `<b>Hello</b>`.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There are many different tags in HTML. Some of these tags have extra properties in the form of *attributes* within the angle brackets. For example, the `<a>` tag encloses text that should be a link, and the `href` attribute determines what URL to link to. Here’s an example:
```html
<a href ="https://inventwithpython .com">This text is a link</a>
```
Some elements have an `id` attribute used to uniquely identify the element in the page. You’ll often instruct your programs to seek out an element by its `id` attribute, so finding this attribute using the browser’s Developer Tools is a common task when writing web scraping programs.

### Viewing a Web Page’s Source:
You’ll need to look at the HTML of the web pages your programs will work with, called the *source*. To do this, right-click any web page in your web browser (or ctrl-click it on macOS), and select **View Source** or **View page source**. The source is the text your browser actually receives. The browser knows how to display, or _render_, the web page from this HTML.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You won’t need HTML mastery to write simple web scraping programs. You just need enough knowledge to pick out data from an existing site.
