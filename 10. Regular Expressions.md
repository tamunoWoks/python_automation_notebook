## REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
*Regular expressions* allow you to specify a pattern of text to search for. We recognize all sorts of other text patterns every day: email addresses have @ symbols in the middle, US Social Security numbers have nine digits and two hyphens, website URLs often have periods and forward slashes, news headlines use title case, and social media hashtags begin with # and contain no spaces, to give some examples.
