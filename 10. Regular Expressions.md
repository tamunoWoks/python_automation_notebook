## REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
We recognize all sorts of other text patterns every day: email addresses have @ symbols in the middle, US Social Security numbers have nine digits and two hyphens, website URLs often have periods and forward slashes, news headlines use title case, and social media hashtags begin with # and contain no spaces, to give some examples. ***Regular expressions*** allow you to specify a pattern of text.  

Regular expressions are helpful, but few nonprogrammers know about them, even though most modern text editors and word processors have find-and-replace features that can search based on regular expressions.They are huge time-savers, not just for software users but also for programmers.

Tech writer Cory Doctorow argues:  
> "Knowing regular expressions can mean the difference between solving a problem in 3 steps and solving it in 3,000 steps. When you’re a nerd, you forget that the problems you solve with a couple keystrokes can take other people days of tedious, error-prone work to slog through."

### Finding Text Patterns Without Regular Expressions:
Say you want to find a US phone number in a string; you’re looking for three numbers, a hyphen, three numbers, a hyphen, and four numbers. Here’s an example: 415-555-4242.
Let’s write a function to check whether a string matches this pattern and return either `True` or `False`.
```python
def isPhoneNumber(text):
    if len(text) != 12:
        return False
    
    for i in range(0,3):
        if not text[i].isdecimal():
            return False
        
    if text[3] != '-':
        return False
    
    for i in range(4,7):
        if not text[i].isdecimal():
            return False
        
    if text[7] != '-':
        return False
    
    for i in range(8,12):
        if not text[i].isdecimal():
            return False
        
    return True
```
