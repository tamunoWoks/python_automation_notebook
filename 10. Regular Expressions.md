## REGULAR EXPRESSIONS
We recognize all sorts of other text patterns every day: email addresses have @ symbols in the middle, US Social Security numbers have nine digits and two hyphens, website URLs often have periods and forward slashes, news headlines use title case, and social media hashtags begin with # and contain no spaces, to give some examples. ***Regular expressions*** allow you to specify a pattern of text.  

Regular expressions are helpful, but few nonprogrammers know about them, even though most modern text editors and word processors have find-and-replace features that can search based on regular expressions.They are huge time-savers, not just for software users but also for programmers.
