## Web Scraping
*Web scraping* is a term for using a program to download and process content from the web. For example, Google runs many web scraping programs to index web pages for its search engine. Let's learn about the following modules, which make it easy to scrape web pages in Python:
- **`webbrowser`** - Comes with Python and opens a browser to a specific page
- **`requests`** - Downloads files and web pages from the internet
- **Beautiful Soup (`bs4`)** - Parses HTML, the format that web pages are written in, to extract the information you want
- **Selenium** - Launches and controls a web browser, such as by filling in forms and simulating mouse clicks
- **Playwright** - Launches and controls a web browser; newer than Selenium and has some additional features.

### HTTP and HTTPS:
When you visit a website, its web address, such as *https://autbor.com /example3.html*, is known as a *uniform resource locator (URL)*. The *HTTPS* in the URL stands for *Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure*, the protocol that your web browser uses to access websites.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More precisely, HTTPS is an encrypted version of HTTP, so it protects your privacy while you use the internet. If you were using HTTP, identity thieves, national intelligence agencies, and your internet service provider could view the content of the web pages you visited, including any passwords and credit card information you submit. Using a virtual private network (VPN) could keep your internet service provider from viewing your internet traffic; however, now the VPN provider would be able to view your traffic. An unscrupulous VPN provider could then sell information about what websites you visit to data brokers.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By contrast, any web page content you view with HTTPS will be encrypted and hidden. Websites used to use HTTPS only for pages that sent passwords and credit card numbers, but nowadays, most websites encrypt all 
traffic. Keep in mind, though, that the identity of the website you visit can still be known; no one will be able to see exactly what you download from CatPhotos.com, but they will see that you were connecting to the CatPhotos.com website and can figure out that you were probably looking at photos of cats. The Tor Browser, which uses the Tor anonymization network, can provide true anonymous browsing.
