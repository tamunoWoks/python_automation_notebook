## Web Scraping
*Web scraping* is a term for using a program to download and process content from the web. For example, Google runs many web scraping programs to index web pages for its search engine. Let's learn about the following modules, which make it easy to scrape web pages in Python:
- **`webbrowser`** - Comes with Python and opens a browser to a specific page
- **`requests`** - Downloads files and web pages from the internet
- **Beautiful Soup (`bs4`)** - Parses HTML, the format that web pages are written in, to extract the information you want
- **Selenium** - Launches and controls a web browser, such as by filling in forms and simulating mouse clicks
- **Playwright** - Launches and controls a web browser; newer than Selenium and has some additional features.
