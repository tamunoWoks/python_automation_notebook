## The Syntax of Regular Expressions
Let's learn how to group regular expression elements together with parentheses, escape special characters, match several alternative groups with the pipe character, and return all matches with the `findall()` method.

### Grouping with Parentheses:
Say you want to separate one smaller part of the matched text, such as the area code, from the rest of the phone number (to, for example, perform some operation on it). Adding parentheses will create groups in the regex string: `r'(\d\d\d)-(\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d)'`. Then, you can use the `group()` method of Match objects to grab the matching text from just one group.  

The first set of parentheses in a regex string will be group 1. The second set will be group 2. By passing the integer 1 or 2 to the `group(`) method, you can grab different parts of the matched text. Passing 0 or nothing to the `group()` method will return the entire matched text. For example:
```python
import re

phone_re = re .compile(r'(\d\d\d) -(\d\d\d -\d\d\d\d)')
mo = phone_re.search('My number is 415-555-4242.')

mo.group(1)  # '415'
mo.group(2)  # '555-4242'
mo.group(0)  # '415-555-4242'
mo.group()  # '415-555-4242'
```
