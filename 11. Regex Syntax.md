## The Syntax of Regular Expressions
Let's learn how to group regular expression elements together with parentheses, escape special characters, match several alternative groups with the pipe character, and return all matches with the `findall()` method.

### Grouping with Parentheses:
Say you want to separate one smaller part of the matched text, such as the area code, from the rest of the phone number (to, for example, perform some operation on it). Adding parentheses will create groups in the regex string: `r'(\d\d\d)-(\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d)'`. Then, you can use the `group()` method of Match objects to grab the matching text from just one group.  

The first set of parentheses in a regex string will be group 1. The second set will be group 2. By passing the integer 1 or 2 to the `group(`) method, you can grab different parts of the matched text. Passing 0 or nothing to the `group()` method will return the entire matched text. For example:
```python
import re

phone_re = re .compile(r'(\d\d\d) -(\d\d\d -\d\d\d\d)')
mo = phone_re.search('My number is 415-555-4242.')

mo.group(1)  # '415'
mo.group(2)  # '555-4242'
mo.group(0)  # '415-555-4242'
mo.group()  # '415-555-4242'
```
If you would like to retrieve all the groups at once, use the `groups()` method (note the plural form in the name):
```python
mo.groups() # ('415', '555-4242')

area_code, main_number = mo.groups()

print(area_code) # 415
print(main_number) # 555-4242
```
Because `mo.groups()` returns a tuple of multiple values, you can use the multiple-assignment trick to assign each value to a separate variable.

### Using Escape Characters:
Parentheses create groups in regular expressions and are not interpreted as part of the text pattern. To match a parenthesis in your text, for instance, maybe the phone numbers you are trying to match have the area code set in parentheses: '(415) 555-4242'.  In this case, you need to escape the ( and ) characters with a backslash. The `\(` and `\)` escaped parentheses will be interpreted as part of the pattern you are matching. For example:
```python
pattern = re .compile(r'(\(\d\d\d\)) (\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d)')

mo = pattern.search('My phone number is (415) 555-4242.')

mo.group(1) # '(415)'
mo.group(2) # '555-4242'
```
The `\(` and `\)` escape characters in the raw string passed to `re.compile()` will match actual parenthesis characters. In regular expressions, the following characters have special meanings:
```txt
 # $ & ( ) * + - . ? [ \ ] ^ { | } ~
```
If you want to detect these characters as part of your text pattern, you need to escape them with a backslash:
```txt
 \# \$ \& \( \) \* \+ \- \. \? \[ \\ \] \^ \{ \| \} \~
```
Always double-check that you haven’t mistaken escaped parentheses `\(` and `\)` for unescaped parentheses ( and ) in a regular expression. If you receive an error message about “missing )” or “unbalanced parenthesis,” you may have forgotten to include the closing unescaped parenthesis for a group, like in this example:
```python
import re
re .compile(r'(\(Parentheses\)')
Traceback (most recent call last):
--snip-
re.error: missing ), unterminated subpattern at position 0
```
The error message tells you that there is an opening parenthesis at index `0` of the `r'(\(Parentheses\)'` string that is missing its corresponding closing parenthesis. We can use the `Humre` module to prevent these kinds of typos.

###  Matching Characters from Alternate Groups:
The `|` character is called a *pipe*, and it’s used as the *alternation operator* in regular expressions. You can use it anywhere you want to match one of multiple expressions. For example, the regular expression `r'Cat|Dog'` will match either `'Cat'` or `'Dog'`.  

You can also use the pipe to match one of several patterns as part of your regex. For example, say you wanted to match any of the strings `'Caterpillar'`, `'Catastrophe'`, `'Catch'`, or `'Category'`. Since all of these strings start with `Cat`, it would be nice if you could specify that prefix only once. You can do this by using the pipe within parentheses to separate the possible suffixes. For example:
```python
import re

pattern = re .compile(r'Cat(erpillar|astrophe|ch|egory)')
match = pattern.search('Catch me if you can.')

match.group() # 'Catch'
match.group(1) # 'ch
```
The method call `match.group()` returns the full matched text `'Catch'`, while `match.group(1)` returns just the part of the matched text inside the first parentheses group, `'ch'`. By using the pipe character and grouping parentheses, you can specify several alternative patterns you would like your regex to match.  
If you need to match an actual pipe character, escape it with a backslash, like `\|`.

### Returning All Matches:
In addition to a `search()` method, Pattern objects have a `findall()` method. While `search()` will return a Match object of the *first* matched text in the searched string, the `findall()` method will return the strings of *every* match in the searched string.
