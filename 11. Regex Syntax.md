## The Syntax of Regular Expressions
Let's learn how to group regular expression elements together with parentheses, escape special characters, match several alternative groups with the pipe character, and return all matches with the `findall()` method.

### Grouping with Parentheses:
Say you want to separate one smaller part of the matched text, such as the area code, from the rest of the phone number (to, for example, perform some operation on it). Adding parentheses will create groups in the regex string: `r'(\d\d\d)-(\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d)'`. Then, you can use the `group()` method of Match objects to grab the matching text from just one group.  

The first set of parentheses in a regex string will be group 1. The second set will be group 2. By passing the integer 1 or 2 to the `group(`) method, you can grab different parts of the matched text. Passing 0 or nothing to the `group()` method will return the entire matched text. For example:
```python
import re

phone_re = re .compile(r'(\d\d\d) -(\d\d\d -\d\d\d\d)')
mo = phone_re.search('My number is 415-555-4242.')

mo.group(1)  # '415'
mo.group(2)  # '555-4242'
mo.group(0)  # '415-555-4242'
mo.group()  # '415-555-4242'
```
If you would like to retrieve all the groups at once, use the `groups()` method (note the plural form in the name):
```python
mo.groups() # ('415', '555-4242')

area_code, main_number = mo.groups()

print(area_code) # 415
print(main_number) # 555-4242
```
Because `mo.groups()` returns a tuple of multiple values, you can use the multiple-assignment trick to assign each value to a separate variable.

### Using Escape Characters:
Parentheses create groups in regular expressions and are not interpreted as part of the text pattern. To match a parenthesis in your text, for instance, maybe the phone numbers you are trying to match have the area code set in parentheses: '(415) 555-4242'.  In this case, you need to escape the ( and ) characters with a backslash. The \( and \) escaped parentheses will be interpreted as part of the pattern you are matching. For example:
```python
pattern = re .compile(r'(\(\d\d\d\)) (\d\d\d-\d\d\d\d)')

mo = pattern.search('My phone number is (415) 555-4242.')

mo.group(1) # '(415)'
mo.group(2) # '555-4242'
```
The \( and \) escape characters in the raw string passed to `re.compile()` will match actual parenthesis characters. In regular expressions, the following characters have special meanings:
```txt
 # $ & ( ) * + - . ? [ \ ] ^ { | } ~
```
